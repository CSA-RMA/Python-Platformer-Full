Using http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/en/sprite_sheets/ as a base, I added content to create fully fledged game in Python 3. 
This content included enemy characters, collectibles/coins, and a user interface. 
Originally, the project was based off of C++, but after realizing the scale of the project and the time allocated, the project was changed to be based off of Python 3.
